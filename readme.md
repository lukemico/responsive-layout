Installing

To view the files locally using Python SimpleServer -

		python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]

	* This shows the files and directories which are in the current working directory.

	* In your terminal, 'cd' or change directory into whichever directory you wish to have accessible via browsers and HTTP.
